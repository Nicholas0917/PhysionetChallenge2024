## Classification
#### Next steps
- get sampling frequency from header_file to pass into resnet args
- finish args dict for initialisation

#### After it works
- right now, demographics for classifcation are sex and age, is it worth adding height and weight?
- metric functions/validation
- dynamically determine number of ECG leads
- refactor train test splot in team_code.py

#### Low priority
- investigate 'Bottleneck' in seresnet18.py
